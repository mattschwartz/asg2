We are using all three slip days for this assignment.

Matt previously turned in his personal version of the project that doesn't even use Bullet.  Please disregard it.  The version I'm turning in now uses Bullet.

To build:
./buildit


All in one line:
tar xvf files.tgz;cd turnin-dir;./buildit;./assignment2


The executable is named assignment2
